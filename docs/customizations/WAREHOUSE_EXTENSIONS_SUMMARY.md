---

## Database Changes

### New Table: warehouse_print_jobs

```sql
CREATE TABLE warehouse_print_jobs (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    entity_type VARCHAR(20),  -- zone, shelf, rack, document
    entity_ids UUID[],  -- Array of entity IDs to print
    printer_id UUID,  -- References printers table
    copies INTEGER (1-10),
    status VARCHAR(20),  -- queued, printing, completed, failed, cancelled
    notes TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP,
    completed_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

**Indexes:**
- entity_type
- status
- printer_id
- created_at

**Triggers:**
- Auto-update updated_at timestamp

---

## Integration Points

### 1. Existing Physical Print System
- Reuses `printers` table from physical documents system
- Compatible with existing print templates
- Shares print job management patterns

### 2. Barcode Management
- Updates barcode_status lifecycle:
  - `generated` → `printed` (when labels printed)
  - `printed` → `assigned` (when entity activated)
  - `assigned` → `scanned` (during mobile scanning)

### 3. Document Movements Table
- Uses existing `document_movements` table
- Full implementation of movement tracking now complete
- Ready for audit trail and reporting
