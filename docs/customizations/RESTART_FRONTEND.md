# âœ… Frontend URL Fixed - Restart Required

## Issue Fixed
The `.env.local` had the wrong URL causing frontend to fail connecting to backend:
- **Before**: `VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8001/api/v1`
- **After**: `VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8001` âœ…

## Action Required: Restart Frontend

### Option 1: Restart Frontend (Recommended)
```bash
# In the terminal running the frontend, press Ctrl+C to stop
# Then restart:
cd pie-docs-frontend
npm run dev
```

### Option 2: Hard Refresh Browser (Quick)
1. Open http://localhost:3001/search
2. Press **Ctrl + Shift + R** (Windows/Linux) or **Cmd + Shift + R** (Mac)
3. This clears cached environment variables

## Test It Works

After restarting/refreshing, check browser console (F12):
```
Expected output:
âœ… RAG Backend connected successfully
Backend URL: http://localhost:8001
```

Then try a query:
- Go to http://localhost:3001/search
- Click "Semantic Search" tab
- Type: "Do we have an invoice for Openpos?"
- Should get **GPT-5-nano curated response** (not demo mode!)

## What You'll See

**Before (Demo Mode):**
```
I'm currently running in demo mode. Connect to the backend API...
Sources: Demo Content
```

**After (GPT-5-nano Working):**
```
Yes, you have Invoice #IVP50469986 for Openpos...
Sources: IVIP50469986.pdf (Invoice)
```

**Backend is ready with GPT-5-nano!** Just restart the frontend. ðŸš€
