# 🚀 Final Setup Steps - Your RAG System is 95% Complete!

## ✅ What's Already Working

Your intelligent document search system is **fully implemented** and ready to go:

- ✅ **Backend API**: Running on http://localhost:8001
- ✅ **Database**: PostgreSQL with pgvector + embeddings
- ✅ **Embedding Model**: sentence-transformers (FREE, LOCAL)
- ✅ **GPT-5-nano**: Configured ($0.05/1M tokens - 95% cheaper!)
- ✅ **Frontend**: Ready at http://localhost:3001
- ✅ **3 Invoices**: Processed with embeddings

## 🔑 Single Step Remaining: Add Your OpenAI API Key

### Why You Need This:
Without an API key, you get **raw data dumps**. With GPT-5-nano, you get **intelligent answers**:

**Before (Current - No API Key):**
```
Query: "Do we have an invoice for openpos?"
Response: "From IVIP50469986.pdf: Date: 30 Mar 2023 Invoice No: IVP50469986..."
[Shows all raw data]
```

**After (With API Key):**
```
Query: "Do we have an invoice for openpos?"
Response: "Yes, Invoice #IVP50469986 for Openpos ($39.00 USD) dated March 30, 2023."
[Clean, curated answer]
```

## 📋 Add Your API Key (2 Minutes)

### Step 1: Get API Key
1. Visit: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. Sign in / Create account
3. Click **"Create new secret key"**
4. **Copy the key** (starts with `sk-proj-` or `sk-`)

### Step 2: Add Minimum $5
- Go to: https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/billing
- Add payment method
- Add **$5 minimum** (required for API access)
- This gives you ~50,000 queries!

### Step 3: Update .env File
```bash
# Open file:
pie-docs-backend\.env

# Find line 8:
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here

# Replace with your actual key:
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-YOUR-ACTUAL-KEY-HERE

# Save file
```

### Step 4: Test It
```bash
cd pie-docs-backend
python test_openai_connection.py
```

Expected output:
```
✅ SUCCESS! OpenAI API is working!
   Model: gpt-5-nano
   Response: Hello there!
   Tokens used: 15
   Cost: $0.000003 (~0.0003 cents)

🎉 Your RAG system is ready to use GPT-5-nano!
```

## 🧪 Try Your System

### Option 1: Frontend (Recommended)
1. Open: http://localhost:3001/search
2. Click **"Semantic Search"** tab
3. Try these questions:
   - "Do we have an invoice for Openpos?"
   - "What invoices do we have from 2023?"
   - "Show me all Google invoices"
   - "What was the total for Envato purchases?"

### Option 2: API (Testing)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/api/v1/search/rag \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"query\": \"Do we have an invoice for openpos?\", \"top_k\": 5}"
```

## 💰 Cost Breakdown (GPT-5-nano)

### Pricing:
- **Input**: $0.05 per 1M tokens
- **Output**: $0.40 per 1M tokens

### Real Costs:
- **Per Query**: ~$0.0001 (0.01 cents)
- **100 Queries**: ~$0.01 (1 cent)
- **$5 Budget**: ~50,000 questions!

### Example Invoice Queries:
```
Query: "Summarize all my invoices"
Tokens: ~500 input, ~200 output
Cost: $0.00011 (~0.01 cents)
```

## 🎯 What Happens After You Add the Key

### Automatic Changes:
1. Backend will detect the key on next request
2. GPT-5-nano will generate intelligent responses
3. Frontend will show curated answers (not raw data)
4. Source attribution remains (with confidence scores)

### No Restart Needed!
The system will pick up the key automatically on the next query.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Test Script Shows "API key not configured"
→ Check you saved the `.env` file after editing
→ Make sure no extra spaces around the key

### "Authentication Error"
→ API key is invalid - get a new one from OpenAI
→ Make sure you copied the entire key (starts with `sk-proj-` or `sk-`)

### "Insufficient Funds"
→ Add $5 minimum to your OpenAI account
→ Check: https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/billing

### "Model not found: gpt-5-nano"
→ Verify you have API access to GPT-5 models
→ Check: https://platform.openai.com/account/limits
→ Alternative: Change to `gpt-4o-mini` in .env if GPT-5 not available

### Frontend Still Shows "Demo Mode"
→ Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
→ Check browser console (F12) for errors
→ Verify backend is running: `curl http://localhost:8001/health`
