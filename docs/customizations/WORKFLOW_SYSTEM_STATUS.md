---

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. **JSONB Serialization Issues (CRITICAL)**
   - **File:** `pie-docs-backend/app/routers/workflows.py`
   - **Fixes Applied:**
     - Line 123-124: `create_workflow` endpoint - Added `json.dumps()` for elements/connections
     - Line 217, 221: `update_workflow` endpoint - Added `json.dumps()` for elements/connections
     - Line 561-562: `import_workflow` endpoint - Added `json.dumps()` for elements/connections

   - **File:** `pie-docs-backend/app/services/workflow_execution.py`
   - **Fixes Applied:**
     - Line 467: `start_execution` - Added `json.dumps()` for execution_data
     - Line 561: `execute_next_step` - Added `json.dumps()` for updated_data

### 2. **Missing Type Import (CRITICAL)**
   - **File:** `pie-docs-backend/app/routers/metadata_extraction.py`
   - **Fix:** Added `Tuple` to typing imports on line 12
   - **Impact:** Prevented backend startup failure

## ⚙️ Workflow Execution Engine

### 5 Step Handlers Implemented:

1. **ApprovalStepHandler**
   - Creates approval requests in database
   - Configurable: approvers list, timeout, requires_all flag
   - Waits for external approval action

2. **ReviewStepHandler**
   - Creates review tasks
   - Assigns to reviewers with deadlines
   - Tracks task completion

3. **NotificationStepHandler**
   - Sends notifications to users
   - Configurable recipients and notification type
   - Immediate completion (non-blocking)

4. **DecisionStepHandler**
   - Evaluates conditions
   - Routes workflow based on result
   - Supports: key existence checks, equality checks

5. **TimerStepHandler**
   - Schedules workflow delays
   - Configurable: days, hours, minutes
   - Resumes execution after timeout

### Execution Flow:
```
Start → Find First Step → Execute Handler → Check Waiting State
                                            ↓
                                    If Waiting: Pause
                                    If Complete: Next Step
                                            ↓
                                    Repeat Until Done
                                            ↓
                                    Mark as Completed
```

## 📝 Code Quality Notes

### ★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────
**PostgreSQL JSONB Handling Best Practices**

1. **Always serialize Python objects**: PostgreSQL's psycopg2 adapter cannot automatically convert Python dicts/lists to JSONB. Always use `json.dumps()` before passing to SQL.

2. **Type annotations are critical**: Python 3.10+ requires explicit imports for generic types like `Tuple`, `List`, `Dict` when used as type hints. Missing imports cause NameError at module load time.

3. **Workflow execution patterns**: The "waiting" state pattern allows workflows to pause for external events (approvals, timers) without blocking the system. This is implemented through status flags in step handler responses.

## ⚠️ Known Minor Issues (Non-Critical)

1. **Pydantic V2 Warnings**: Multiple warnings about deprecated config keys (`orm_mode`, `schema_extra`, etc.). These are warnings only and don't affect functionality. Can be fixed by updating Pydantic model configurations.

2. **Audit Log Trigger Issue**: There's a database trigger error related to missing `entity_type` field in audit logs. This doesn't affect workflow functionality but should be fixed for proper audit logging.
