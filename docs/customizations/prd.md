• Provide comprehensive physical document tracking integration with barcode management and location tracking
• Achieve 75% reduction in document processing time and 95% user adoption rate within 9 months
• Deliver modern UI/UX using Tailwind CSS without Next.js framework, optimized for mobile-first responsive design
• Integrate all 36 features from DAS Feature Checklist with 30+ page specifications from the brainstorm document

### Background Context

Enterprise organizations struggle with fragmented document management systems that fail to bridge the gap between physical and digital assets, resulting in $2.4M annually in lost productivity. The PIE DOCS Frontend addresses this by combining proven document management principles with cutting-edge technology, featuring AI-powered automation, bilingual excellence, and seamless physical-digital integration.

This PRD builds on comprehensive brainstorming and feature analysis, consolidating overlapping pages while maintaining 100% feature coverage from both source documents. The system will serve as a unified interface for managing both digital documents and physical document tracking, with real-time synchronization and modern conversational AI capabilities.
