- **Weighted**: Based on approver importance/role
- **Any One**: First decision determines outcome

### Smart Routing

- Document type
- Field values (e.g., contract value > $50,000)
- Metadata conditions
- Priority levels

### Escalation Management
- **Auto-escalation**: Based on timeout rules
- **Manual escalation**: With reason tracking
- **Escalation chains**: Multiple levels of escalation
- **Reminders**: Email, Slack, Teams notifications

### Audit Trail

- Export capabilities (CSV, JSON, PDF)
- IP address and user agent tracking

### Document Annotations

## üêõ Known Issues & Notes

### Routing Rules API
- Some old routing rules from initial seed had incorrect format (array instead of object)
- These have been cleaned up
- All current routing rules use proper JSON object format

### Authentication
- Some endpoints return 401 (Unauthorized) if auth token not provided
- This is expected behavior for production security
- For testing, you may need to authenticate first
