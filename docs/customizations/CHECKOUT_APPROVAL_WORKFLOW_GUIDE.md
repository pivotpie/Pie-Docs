# Document Checkout Approval Workflow - Complete Guide

## 🎯 What Was Built

A **fully automated workflow** that triggers whenever a document is checked out, automatically creating an approval request that appears in the Approval Requests page.

---

## 📋 System Components

### 1. **Workflow Definition** (Database)
**ID:** `3577967d-b8f1-46c2-870d-f3016d416471`
**Name:** "Document Checkout Approval Workflow"
**Status:** Active

#### Workflow Structure:
```
[Trigger: Document Checkout]
         ↓
[Action: Notify User]
         ↓
[Approval: Manager Approval Required]
         ↓
[Logic: Check Approval Status]
      ↙     ↘
[Approved]  [Rejected]
      ↓         ↓
[Email: Success]  [Email: Rejection]
      ↘     ↙
    [End Workflow]
```

#### Element Breakdown:
1. **trigger-database** - Monitors document checkout events
2. **action-notification** - Sends notification to user
3. **flow-approval** - Creates approval request (3-day timeout)
4. **logic-if** - Checks if approved or rejected
5. **action-email** - Sends appropriate email based on decision
6. **flow-end** - Completes workflow

### 2. **Backend Integration** (Code Changes)

#### File: `app/routers/checkinout.py`
**Lines Modified:** 11-20, 83-145

**Changes:**
- Imported `WorkflowExecutionEngine`
- Fixed foreign key constraint issue (locked_by field)
- Added workflow trigger after successful checkout
- Graceful error handling (workflow failure doesn't block checkout)

**Workflow Trigger Logic:**
```python
# After checkout record is created:
1. Query database for "Document Checkout Approval Workflow"
2. If found and active, start workflow execution
3. Pass checkout context data:
   - checkout_id
   - checkout_user
   - checkout_reason
   - checkout_date
4. Log execution start
```

### 3. **Workflow Execution Flow**

When a document is checked out:

```
User Action: POST /api/v1/checkinout/checkout
         ↓
1. Create checkout record in DB
2. Create document lock
3. Log audit trail
         ↓
4. Find "Document Checkout Approval Workflow"
5. Start workflow execution
         ↓
6. Workflow executes first step (trigger)
7. Moves to notification step
8. Creates approval request in DB
         ↓
9. Approval request appears in Approval Requests page
10. Manager can approve/reject
         ↓
11. Workflow continues based on decision
12. Sends email notification
13. Completes workflow
```

## 🚀 How to Test

### Prerequisites
- Backend server must be **restarted** to load code changes
- At least one document must exist in the database
- Admin user must be logged in

### Step 1: Restart Backend Server

```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd pie-docs-backend

# Kill existing process
taskkill /F /IM python.exe /FI "WINDOWTITLE eq uvicorn*"

# Start server
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001
```

### Step 2: Test Checkout via API

```bash
# Login and get token
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"admin","password":"admin123"}'

# Checkout a document (replace TOKEN and DOC_ID)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/api/v1/checkinout/checkout \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "document_id": "YOUR_DOCUMENT_ID",
    "reason": "Testing approval workflow",
    "checkout_notes": "This should trigger an approval request"
  }'
```

### Step 3: Verify Approval Request Created

```bash
# Check approval requests
curl -X GET http://localhost:8001/api/v1/approvals/requests \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

**Expected Result:**
- A new approval request should exist
- Status: "pending"
- Request message: "Manager Approval Required"
- Assigned to: Admin user (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001)
- Deadline: 3 days from checkout

### Step 4: Test via Frontend

1. Go to **Documents** page
2. Find a document
3. Click **Check Out** button
4. Fill in checkout form:
   - Reason: "Testing workflow"
   - Notes: "Should create approval"
5. Submit checkout

6. Navigate to **Approvals** page
7. **Verify:** New approval request appears
8. **Approve or Reject** the request
9. **Check:** Email should be sent (check logs)

## 📊 Database Tables Involved

### Workflows
```sql
SELECT id, name, status, created_at
FROM workflows
WHERE name = 'Document Checkout Approval Workflow';
```

### Workflow Executions
```sql
SELECT id, workflow_id, document_id, status, started_at, completed_at
FROM workflow_executions
ORDER BY started_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Approval Requests
```sql
SELECT id, document_id, workflow_id, status, request_message, deadline
FROM approval_requests
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Checkout Records
```sql
SELECT id, document_id, user_name, status, checkout_date, reason
FROM document_checkout_records
ORDER BY checkout_date DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: Workflow Not Triggering
**Symptoms:** Checkout succeeds but no approval request created

**Solutions:**
1. Check backend logs for errors
2. Verify workflow exists and is active:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM workflows WHERE name = 'Document Checkout Approval Workflow';
   ```
3. Check workflow_executions table for execution records
4. Ensure backend was restarted after code changes

### Issue 2: Approval Request Not Appearing
**Symptoms:** Workflow executes but no approval request in database

**Solutions:**
1. Check if ApprovalStepHandler is being triggered:
   - Look for log: "Processing approval step"
2. Verify approval_requests table has data:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM approval_requests ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;
   ```
3. Check workflow execution status:
   ```sql
   SELECT status, error_message FROM workflow_executions
   WHERE id = 'YOUR_EXECUTION_ID';
   ```

### Issue 3: Foreign Key Constraint Error
**Symptoms:** `document_locks_locked_by_fkey` violation

**Solutions:**
1. **Restart backend server** - The fix is already in the code
2. The updated code uses admin user ID as fallback:
   ```python
   locked_by_user = str(user_id) if user_id else "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001"
   ```

### Issue 4: Workflow Execution Fails
**Symptoms:** Workflow starts but status becomes "failed"

**Solutions:**
1. Check error_message and error_stack in workflow_executions table
2. Review backend logs for detailed error
3. Verify all workflow elements have valid configurations
4. Check that approval handler can access database

## 📈 Monitoring

### Check Workflow Execution History
```sql
SELECT
    we.id,
    w.name as workflow_name,
    d.title as document_title,
    we.status,
    we.started_at,
    we.completed_at,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (we.completed_at - we.started_at))/60 as duration_minutes
FROM workflow_executions we
JOIN workflows w ON w.id = we.workflow_id
LEFT JOIN documents d ON d.id = we.document_id
ORDER BY we.started_at DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

### Check Approval Request Success Rate
```sql
SELECT
    status,
    COUNT(*) as count,
    ROUND(COUNT(*) * 100.0 / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER(), 2) as percentage
FROM approval_requests
WHERE workflow_id = '3577967d-b8f1-46c2-870d-f3016d416471'
GROUP BY status;
```

### Recent Checkout-to-Approval Pipeline
```sql
SELECT
    cr.id as checkout_id,
    cr.document_id,
    cr.checkout_date,
    we.id as execution_id,
    we.status as workflow_status,
    ar.id as approval_id,
    ar.status as approval_status
FROM document_checkout_records cr
LEFT JOIN workflow_executions we ON we.document_id = cr.document_id
    AND we.started_at >= cr.checkout_date
LEFT JOIN approval_requests ar ON ar.workflow_id = we.workflow_id
    AND ar.document_id = cr.document_id
ORDER BY cr.checkout_date DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
