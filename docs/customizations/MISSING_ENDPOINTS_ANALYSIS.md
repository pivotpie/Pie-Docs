## Recommended Enhancements

While NO endpoints are blocked, these enhancements could improve the system:

### 1. Optional Additions (Not Required)

#### Email Queue Table
**Purpose:** Store outbound emails for retry logic
**Priority:** Low (can use external service)
**Benefit:** Better email delivery tracking

```sql
CREATE TABLE email_queue (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    to_email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    subject VARCHAR(500) NOT NULL,
    body TEXT NOT NULL,
    status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'pending',
    retry_count INT DEFAULT 0,
    sent_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

#### File Upload Chunks
**Purpose:** Support resumable file uploads
**Priority:** Low (can handle in application layer)
**Benefit:** Better large file upload reliability

```sql
CREATE TABLE upload_chunks (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    upload_id UUID NOT NULL,
    chunk_number INT NOT NULL,
    chunk_data BYTEA,
    uploaded_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### 2. Performance Indexes (Recommended)

Add these indexes for better query performance:

```sql
-- Search optimization
CREATE INDEX idx_documents_search ON documents USING GIN (search_vector);
CREATE INDEX idx_documents_tags ON documents USING GIN (tags);

-- Frequently queried relationships
CREATE INDEX idx_documents_folder_id ON documents(folder_id) WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;
CREATE INDEX idx_documents_status ON documents(status) WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;
CREATE INDEX idx_documents_type ON documents(document_type) WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;

-- OCR job tracking
CREATE INDEX idx_ocr_jobs_status ON ocr_jobs(status) WHERE status IN ('pending', 'processing');

-- Approval tracking
CREATE INDEX idx_approval_requests_status ON approval_requests(status) WHERE status = 'pending';
CREATE INDEX idx_approval_requests_assigned ON approval_requests USING GIN (assigned_to);

-- Analytics optimization
CREATE INDEX idx_search_history_user_created ON search_history(user_id, created_at);
CREATE INDEX idx_audit_logs_user_created ON audit_logs(user_id, created_at);
```

### 3. Materialized Views (Optional)

For better analytics performance:

```sql
-- Popular content summary
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW popular_documents_summary AS
SELECT
    d.id,
    d.title,
    pc.access_count,
    pc.download_count,
    pc.share_count,
    pc.trend_direction
FROM documents d
JOIN popular_content pc ON d.id = pc.document_id
WHERE d.deleted_at IS NULL
ORDER BY pc.access_count DESC;

-- Refresh strategy: Can be refreshed on schedule or after batch updates
```

### Recommendation

**Proceed with full API implementation** without concern for database limitations.

The current database schema is:
