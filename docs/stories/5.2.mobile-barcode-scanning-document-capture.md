**Barcode System Integration:**
- Story 5.2 builds on the barcode generation system from Story 5.1
- Mobile scanning must validate against barcodes generated in Story 5.1
- QR code metadata schema from Story 5.1 provides embedded information for mobile scanning
- Barcode validation API endpoints established in Story 5.1 support mobile validation

**Shared Technology Foundation:**
- React 18+ with TypeScript for consistent mobile component architecture
- Redux Toolkit with physicalDocsSlice extended for mobile scanning operations
- Same barcode format support (Code 128, Code 39, QR, Data Matrix) for compatibility
- Integration with existing document management and asset tracking systems

### Mobile Architecture Context
[Source: docs/ui-architecture.md#mobile-components, docs/front-end-spec.md#mobile-scanner]

**Progressive Web App (PWA) Architecture:**

- **Barcode Scanning**: Implement `@zxing/browser` for multi-format barcode detection
- **Image Processing**: Use `opencv.js` for document edge detection and enhancement
- **Voice Input**: Integrate Web Speech API for hands-free metadata entry
- **Offline Storage**: Use IndexedDB for large image storage with automatic cleanup
- **Background Sync**: Implement service worker background sync for offline uploads

**Mobile State Management Extension:**
```typescript
// Extended physicalDocsSlice for mobile operations
