- React.memo and useCallback optimizations in place
- Virtualization ready for multi-page documents
- Efficient state management with minimal re-renders
- PDF.js worker configuration for background processing

### Files Modified During Review

No files modified during QA review - code quality sufficient as-implemented.

### Gate Status

Gate: CONCERNS → docs/qa/gates/2.4-document-viewer-metadata-management.yml
Quality Score: 78/100 (Strong implementation with test execution concerns)

**Key Concerns**:
1. **Test Execution**: DownloadControls test suite failing due to DOM mocking recursion
2. **Test Coverage**: Low test coverage ratio (16%) for component suite size
3. **Type Consistency**: Minor - annotation types duplicated instead of shared

### Recommended Status

**⚠️ Changes Required** - Address test execution failures before production deployment
(Story owner decides final status)

**Rationale**: While the implementation quality is excellent and all functional requirements are met, the test execution issues prevent proper CI/CD validation and could mask future regressions. The core functionality is production-ready once testing infrastructure is resolved.
