- **Test Location**: `tests/` directory with structure mirroring `src/`
- **Test Patterns**: Component isolation with mocked dependencies
- **Required Tests**: Unit tests for components, integration tests for workflows
- **Template**: Use standard test template with `render`, `screen`, `fireEvent` from React Testing Library

### Technical Stack Requirements
**Framework Stack**: React 18.2+ with TypeScript 5.0+ and Vite 5.0+ build tool [Source: ui-architecture/frontend-tech-stack.md]

- **Source Organization**: `src/` with components, pages, services, store, hooks, utils, assets structure
- **Build Configuration**: Vite config with TypeScript, Tailwind PostCSS, and absolute imports
- **Environment**: `.env.example` template with API URLs and feature flags

### Development Standards
**Coding Standards**: [Source: ui-architecture/frontend-developer-standards.md]
- **File Naming**: Components in PascalCase.tsx, hooks in camelCase.ts
- **Import Patterns**: Absolute imports using `@/` prefix
- **TypeScript**: Strict interfaces and type definitions required

### Environment Configuration
**Development Setup**: [Source: ui-architecture/environment-configuration.md]
- **Mock Data**: VITE_USE_MOCK_DATA="true" for development
- **Internationalization**: Support for en,ar languages with RTL
- **API Configuration**: Placeholder URLs for future backend integration

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-21

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

Excellent foundational implementation with modern React 18 + TypeScript + Vite stack. Project structure follows best practices with proper separation of concerns. Configuration files are well-organized and optimized for both development and production environments.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: `pie-docs-frontend/src/styles/globals.css`
  - **Change**: Fixed Tailwind v4 import syntax from `@import "tailwindcss"` to proper layer imports
  - **Why**: Tailwind v4 requires `@tailwindcss/postcss` plugin with specific layer syntax
  - **How**: Prevents CSS build failures and enables proper Tailwind functionality

- **File**: `pie-docs-frontend/src/App.test.tsx`
  - **Change**: Completely rewrote tests to work with new Redux + Auth architecture
  - **Why**: Original tests were for Vite counter app, not the authentication system
  - **How**: Added proper Redux Provider and i18n setup for accurate testing

- **File**: `pie-docs-frontend/src/test/testUtils.tsx`
  - **Change**: Created comprehensive test utilities with Redux and i18n setup
  - **Why**: Reusable testing infrastructure needed for authentication components
  - **How**: Provides renderWithProviders helper for consistent test setup

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ ESLint + Prettier configured with TypeScript strict mode
- Project Structure: ✓ Follows established patterns with clear separation of concerns
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Vitest + React Testing Library setup with proper test utilities
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 7 acceptance criteria fully implemented and validated

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Fixed critical CSS build issue with Tailwind v4 syntax (src/styles/globals.css)
- [x] Updated App tests to work with new authentication architecture (src/App.test.tsx)
- [x] Created reusable test utilities for Redux and i18n setup (src/test/testUtils.tsx)
- [ ] Consider adding Storybook for component documentation
- [ ] Add bundle size monitoring to CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Consider performance budgets for production builds

### Security Review

No security concerns identified. TypeScript strict mode enforced, dependency versions are current and secure. Build configuration follows security best practices.

### Performance Considerations

Excellent performance setup with Vite build optimization, code splitting configured, and proper asset handling. Hot reload and development server performance is optimal.

### Files Modified During Review

- `pie-docs-frontend/src/styles/globals.css` - Fixed Tailwind v4 import syntax
- `pie-docs-frontend/src/App.test.tsx` - Updated tests for new architecture
- `pie-docs-frontend/src/test/testUtils.tsx` - Created test utilities (new file)

### Gate Status

Gate: PASS → docs/qa/gates/1.1-project-setup.yml
