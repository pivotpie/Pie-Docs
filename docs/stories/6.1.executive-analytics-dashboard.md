- **Epic 5 Integration**: Physical document tracking and location analytics
- **System-Wide Metrics**: User activity, document processing, and performance data from all system components

**Data Sources:**
- Document management activities from core system
- Workflow execution metrics from Epic 4 stories
- Physical document movement data from Epic 5 stories
- User interaction analytics across all application areas
- System performance metrics from infrastructure monitoring

### Frontend Architecture Context
[Source: docs/ui-architecture.md#analytics-components, docs/front-end-spec.md#analytics-interface]

**React Component Architecture:**
