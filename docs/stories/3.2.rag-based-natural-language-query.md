- **Premature Optimization**: Complex caching and performance metrics before core functionality works
- **Interface Mismatches**: Services expect data structures not provided by other components
- **Incomplete Integration**: Services exist but aren't connected to functional data flow

### Performance Considerations

**UI Performance: Excellent**
- Optimized React patterns with proper memoization
- Efficient Redux state management
- Responsive design with minimal re-renders

**Service Performance: Over-Optimized**
- Complex performance monitoring for unused services
- Memory management for empty data structures
- Queue processing for single-user scenario

### Security Review

**UI Security: Strong**
- Proper XSS protection through React sanitization
- Controlled markdown rendering with safe HTML
- Input validation and length limits

**Service Security: Needs Review**
- No input validation in NLP services
- No rate limiting or abuse prevention
- Cache could grow unbounded without proper limits

### Refactoring Performed
