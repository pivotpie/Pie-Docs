## Dev Notes

### Physical Document System Foundation
This story initiates Epic 5's physical document integration system, creating the foundation for hybrid digital-physical document management. Unlike previous epics that focused on digital workflows, this story bridges the gap between physical assets and digital systems.

### Frontend Architecture Context
[Source: docs/ui-architecture.md#physical-components, docs/front-end-spec.md#barcode-interface]

**React Component Architecture:**
- Use React 18+ with TypeScript for barcode management components
- Implement using Vite build system with specialized barcode libraries
- Follow PascalCase naming: BarcodeGenerator, PrintManager, LabelDesigner
- Use Redux Toolkit with dedicated physicalDocsSlice for state management
- Implement RTK Query for barcode database operations

**Barcode Generation Technology Stack:**
- **Barcode Libraries**: Use `react-barcode-generator` for 1D barcodes
- **QR Code Generation**: Implement `qrcode.js` for QR code creation
- **Canvas Rendering**: Use HTML5 Canvas for barcode image generation
- **Print Integration**: Implement browser print API with custom CSS
- **PDF Generation**: Use `jsPDF` for barcode label PDF export

**Physical Documents State Management:**
```typescript
// physicalDocsSlice.ts structure
interface PhysicalDocsState {
  barcodes: {
    generated: BarcodeRecord[];
    pending: BarcodeGenerationRequest[];
    templates: LabelTemplate[];
    printJobs: PrintJob[];
  };
  assets: {
    documents: PhysicalDocument[];
    equipment: PhysicalAsset[];
    locations: StorageLocation[];
  };
  printing: {
    availablePrinters: Printer[];
    printQueue: PrintJob[];
    printHistory: PrintHistory[];
    templates: PrintTemplate[];
  };
  configuration: {
    barcodeFormats: BarcodeFormat[];
    labelSizes: LabelSize[];
    defaultSettings: BarcodeSettings;
  };
}
```

**Component File Locations:**
