### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Assessment: Strong Foundation with Implementation Gaps**

The implemented components (Tasks 2 & 3) demonstrate excellent engineering practices with comprehensive Elasticsearch integration, sophisticated faceted filtering, and robust testing patterns. The SearchService class shows enterprise-grade architecture with proper error handling, request cancellation, and fallback mechanisms. The FacetedFilterPanel component provides rich user experience with collapsible sections, dynamic metadata filtering, and accessibility features.

**Strengths:**
- Comprehensive Elasticsearch query building with multi-field search and faceted aggregations
- Proper TypeScript typing throughout with well-defined interfaces
- Strong separation of concerns between service layer and UI components
- Extensive test coverage with 126+ test cases covering unit, integration, and edge cases
- Good accessibility foundation with ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation
- Performance optimizations including debouncing, caching, and request cancellation

### Refactoring Performed

**File**: `src/components/search/FacetedFilterPanel.tsx`
- **Change**: Added proper htmlFor attributes to date range and author search input labels
