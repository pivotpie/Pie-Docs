## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
[Source: docs/stories/4.1.visual-workflow-designer.md]

**Workflow Integration Requirements:**
- Story 4.2 builds on the workflow system created in Story 4.1
- Tasks generated from workflow designer must integrate with this dashboard
- Workflow state changes should trigger task status updates
- Task completion should advance workflow to next steps

**Shared Technology Stack:**
- React 18+ with TypeScript for consistent component architecture
- Redux Toolkit with dedicated tasksSlice for state management
- RTK Query for API integration with task endpoints
- Same responsive design patterns and Tailwind CSS styling

### Frontend Architecture Context
[Source: docs/ui-architecture.md#task-dashboard, docs/front-end-spec.md#task-dashboard]

**React Component Architecture:**
- Use React 18+ with TypeScript for component development
- Implement using Vite build system with hot reload
- Follow PascalCase naming: TaskDashboard, TaskCard, KanbanColumn
- Use Redux Toolkit for task state management with tasksSlice
- Implement RTK Query for real-time task updates

**Kanban Implementation:**
- Use React Beautiful DnD for drag-and-drop functionality
- Implement virtual scrolling for large task lists (react-window)
- Create responsive column layout with CSS Grid
- Use Intersection Observer for infinite scroll loading
- Implement optimistic updates for smooth interactions

**Task State Management:**
```typescript
// tasksSlice.ts structure
interface TaskState {
  tasksByStatus: {
    pending: Task[];
    inProgress: Task[];
    completed: Task[];
  };
  selectedTasks: string[];
  filters: {
    priority: string[];
    assignee: string[];
    dateRange: { start: Date | null; end: Date | null };
    search: string;
  };
  notifications: {
    preferences: NotificationSettings;
    unreadCount: number;
    history: Notification[];
  };
  metrics: {
    completionRate: number;
    averageTimeToComplete: number;
    tasksCompletedThisWeek: number;
  };
}
```

**Component File Locations:**
[Source: docs/ui-architecture.md#project-structure]
- Main dashboard: `src/pages/tasks/TaskDashboard.tsx`
- Kanban board: `src/components/tasks/KanbanBoard.tsx`

  - Critical: #EF4444 (red)
  - High: #F59E0B (orange)
  - Medium: #3B82F6 (blue)
  - Low: #64748B (gray)
- Use Framer Motion for smooth transitions and animations
- Implement proper RTL support for Arabic interface

**Real-time Updates:**

### Gate Status

Gate: **CONCERNS** → docs/qa/gates/4.2-task-dashboard-assignment-management.yml

**Risk Profile**: Medium risk due to test coverage gaps
**Primary Concerns**: Limited test coverage could impact maintainability and regression detection

### Recommended Status

**⚠️ CONCERNS - Testing Coverage Needs Attention**

**Rationale**: While the implementation quality is exceptional and all core functionality is working, the limited test coverage (1/10 components) presents a moderate risk for future maintenance and regression detection. The missing calendar export features also represent incomplete AC6 implementation.

**Recommendation**: Address test coverage concerns before production deployment, or accept the technical debt with explicit acknowledgment from the team.

### Test Quality Assessment

**Test Coverage**: ✅ **EXCELLENT** - 72 tests across critical components
**Test Reliability**: ❌ **POOR** - 26% failure rate indicates unstable test suite
**Test Design**: ⚠️ **CONCERNS** - React testing best practices not followed consistently

### Security Review (Updated)

**Status: PASS** ✓ - No new security concerns identified

### Performance Considerations (Updated)

**Status: EXCELLENT** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ - No performance regressions observed

### Files Modified During Review

**No files modified** - Test failures require developer attention

### Gate Status (Updated)

Gate: **CONCERNS** → docs/qa/gates/4.2-task-dashboard-assignment-management.yml

**Primary Risk**: Test suite instability could mask future regressions and impact deployment confidence

### Recommended Status

**⚠️ CONCERNS - Test Suite Reliability Must Be Addressed**

**Rationale**: While all acceptance criteria are now complete and implementation quality remains excellent, the high test failure rate (19/72 tests failing) introduces significant risk for:
- **Regression Detection**: Broken tests cannot catch future bugs
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Failed tests will block automated deployments
- **Development Velocity**: Developers lose confidence in test feedback

**Immediate Actions Required:**
1. Fix all 19 failing tests in BulkOperations test suite
2. Implement proper `act()` wrapping for React state updates
3. Review and correct test assertion logic
4. Verify all tests pass consistently before production deployment

**Alternative**: If time constraints exist, consider temporarily removing broken tests and accepting reduced coverage with explicit team acknowledgment of technical debt.
