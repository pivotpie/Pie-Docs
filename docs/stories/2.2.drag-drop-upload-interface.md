### Files Modified During Review

**No files were modified during review** - implementation quality was already excellent.

### Gate Status

Gate: **CONCERNS** → docs/qa/gates/2.2-drag-drop-upload-interface.yml
Risk profile: Not assessed (no critical risks identified in code review)
NFR assessment: Not required (security/performance addressed in review)

**Concerns Summary:**
1. **Missing Test Coverage**: No test files found for upload functionality
2. **Incomplete Features**: 3 of 8 acceptance criteria not yet implemented (ACs 6-8)
3. **Production Readiness**: Additional security measures needed for production deployment

### Recommended Status

**✗ Changes Required** - Complete remaining acceptance criteria and add comprehensive test coverage before marking as Done.

**Next Steps:**
1. Implement remaining acceptance criteria (file preview, metadata entry, folder upload)
2. Add comprehensive test suite as specified in Task 9
3. Review security measures for production deployment
4. Consider performance testing with large files and concurrent users

**Note for Development Team:** The implemented core functionality (ACs 1-5) is of excellent quality and ready for integration. The remaining work should focus on completing the feature set and ensuring production readiness through testing and security hardening.
