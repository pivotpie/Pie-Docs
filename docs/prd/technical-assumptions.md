# Technical Assumptions

## Repository Structure: Monorepo

The PIE DOCS Frontend will use a monorepo structure to facilitate:
- Shared component library and design system consistency
- Centralized configuration management for Tailwind CSS and build tools
- Unified testing and deployment pipelines
- Easy code sharing between different page modules while maintaining clear separation of concerns

## Service Architecture

**Frontend-Only Architecture**: This PRD focuses exclusively on the frontend mockup application with the following service integration points:
- **Mayan EDMS Backend Integration**: RESTful API consumption for document storage, metadata management, and core EDMS functionality
- **SPAN Physical Tracking Integration**: API integration for barcode management, location tracking, and physical document workflows
- **RAG/NLP Service Integration**: External AI service APIs for natural language processing and document intelligence features
- **Progressive Web App Architecture**: Service worker implementation for offline capabilities and mobile-native experience

## Testing Requirements

**Comprehensive Testing Strategy**: Full testing pyramid approach including:
- **Unit Testing**: Component-level testing for all React components and utility functions
- **Integration Testing**: API integration testing with mock services for Mayan EDMS and SPAN systems
- **End-to-End Testing**: Critical user journey testing covering document upload, search, workflow, and mobile scanning
- **Accessibility Testing**: Automated WCAG compliance testing and screen reader compatibility
- **Cross-Browser Testing**: Compatibility testing across specified browser matrix
- **Mobile Testing**: PWA functionality testing on iOS and Android devices
- **Bilingual Testing**: Arabic RTL layout and functionality testing across all features

## Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

**Core Technology Stack**:
- **Frontend Framework**: React 18+ with TypeScript for type safety and developer experience
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS as the primary utility-first CSS framework (explicitly no Next.js as requested)
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit with RTK Query for efficient API state management
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized production builds
- **PWA Framework**: Workbox for service worker management and offline capabilities

**Arabic/RTL Support**:
- **Internationalization**: React-i18next for dynamic language switching
- **RTL Layout**: CSS logical properties and Tailwind CSS RTL utilities
- **Font Support**: Multi-language font stacks supporting Arabic and English typography
- **Cultural Localization**: Region-specific date, number, and currency formatting

**Mobile and Camera Integration**:
- **Camera API**: HTML5 Media Capture API for document scanning and barcode reading
- **Image Processing**: Client-side image enhancement and document edge detection
- **Offline Storage**: IndexedDB for local document caching and offline operations
- **Push Notifications**: Web Push API for task and workflow notifications

**Performance Optimization**:
- **Code Splitting**: Route-based and component-based lazy loading
- **Virtual Scrolling**: Efficient rendering for large document lists and data tables
- **Image Optimization**: Progressive loading and WebP format support
- **Bundle Optimization**: Tree shaking and modern JavaScript targeting

**Security and Compliance**:
- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 and SAML 2.0 integration support
- **Data Protection**: Local storage encryption and secure session management
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: Strict transport security and secure cookie handling
- **Content Security Policy**: XSS protection and secure resource loading
