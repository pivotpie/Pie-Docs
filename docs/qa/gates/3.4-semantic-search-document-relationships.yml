# Review Notes
review_notes: |
  EXCEPTIONAL TURNAROUND! The Dev team has systematically addressed every concern from the previous CONCERNS gate:

  ✅ TEST-001 RESOLVED: Test isolation dramatically improved with proper beforeEach/afterEach cleanup,
     mock reset, and cache clearing - no more state pollution between tests

  ✅ TEST-002 RESOLVED: AbortController mocking significantly enhanced with proper mock implementation
     and realistic abort scenarios - reliable cancellation testing achieved

  ✅ DOC-001 RESOLVED: Comprehensive JSDoc documentation added to complex vector mathematics functions
     with formulas, parameter explanations, and usage examples

  Test Suite Health: 112/112 tests passing (100% pass rate)
  - Perfect test isolation prevents mock pollution
  - Robust error handling properly validated
  - Mathematical precision confirmed across all vector operations
  - Cross-language functionality thoroughly tested

  This story now demonstrates production-ready semantic search implementation with outstanding
  technical quality. The remaining items are minor cosmetic improvements that can be addressed
  in future iterations without blocking release.
