# Template and Framework Selection

Based on your comprehensive PRD and front-end specifications, I can see you have clearly specified:

**Framework Requirements from PRD:**
- React 18+ with TypeScript (explicitly no Next.js)
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities
- Bilingual support (Arabic RTL/English LTR)
- Integration-ready for Mayan EDMS backend and SPAN physical tracking

**Mockup Development Strategy:**
For immediate mockup development with future backend readiness, I recommend using **Vite + React + TypeScript** as the foundation. This provides:

1. **Rapid Development**: Vite's fast HMR for quick mockup iterations
2. **Modern Tooling**: Built-in TypeScript support and optimized bundling
3. **No Framework Lock-in**: Pure React without Next.js constraints as specified
4. **Backend-Ready**: Clean separation allowing easy API integration later
5. **PWA Support**: Built-in PWA capabilities for mobile mockups

**Starter Template Decision:**
I'll design the architecture around a **custom Vite + React + TypeScript setup** rather than a pre-built template, giving us:
- Complete control over the structure for your specific EDMS requirements
- Tailwind CSS integration with RTL support
- Mock data services that can be easily swapped for real APIs
- Component structure optimized for your 6 epic workflow
