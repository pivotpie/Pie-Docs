### Navigation Structure

**Primary Navigation:** Persistent sidebar navigation with collapsible sections for main functional areas (Documents, Search, Tasks, Physical, Analytics, Admin). Includes language switcher, user profile, and logout in header.

**Secondary Navigation:** Contextual tab navigation within each main section (e.g., Document Library has Grid/List/Tree tabs, Search has Basic/Advanced/AI Chat tabs). Breadcrumb navigation shows hierarchical location.

**Breadcrumb Strategy:** Dynamic breadcrumbs showing: Application Area > Sub-section > Current View/Document, with clickable navigation back to any level. Special handling for nested folder structures and workflow states.

## User Flows

### Document Upload and Processing

**User Goal:** Upload documents to the system with proper metadata and make them searchable through OCR processing

**Entry Points:** Main dashboard upload widget, Document Library upload button, drag-and-drop anywhere in document area

**Success Criteria:** Document successfully uploaded, OCR processing completed, metadata saved, document appears in library and is searchable

#### Flow Diagram
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User selects files] --> B[Drag & drop or file browser]
    B --> C[File validation]
    C --> D{Valid files?}
    D -->|No| E[Error message & retry]
    D -->|Yes| F[Upload progress tracking]
    F --> G[Metadata entry form]
    G --> H[OCR processing starts]
    H --> I[Processing status updates]
    I --> J{OCR complete?}
    J -->|Success| K[Document available in library]
    J -->|Failed| L[Manual retry option]
    K --> M[Success notification]
    L --> H
```

#### Edge Cases & Error Handling:
- File size exceeds limits - Clear error message with size restrictions
- Unsupported file format - List of supported formats with suggestion to convert
- Network interruption during upload - Auto-resume capability with progress preservation
- OCR processing fails - Manual text entry option with original file preserved
- Duplicate file detection - User choice to replace, rename, or skip
- Insufficient storage space - Clear storage usage display with cleanup suggestions

**Notes:** Mobile users can also access this flow through camera capture, which includes automatic document edge detection and image enhancement before following the same metadata and processing flow.

### Natural Language Document Query (RAG-based)

**User Goal:** Ask questions about document content in natural language and receive intelligent answers with source citations

**Entry Points:** Search & AI Chat section, global search bar with AI toggle, voice input button on mobile

**Success Criteria:** User receives relevant, accurate answer with clickable source citations and conversation history is maintained

#### Flow Diagram
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User enters natural language query] --> B{Text or voice input?}
    B -->|Voice| C[Speech-to-text processing]
    B -->|Text| D[Query intent analysis]
    C --> D
    D --> E[Document corpus search]
    E --> F[Context retrieval from relevant docs]
    F --> G[AI answer generation]
    G --> H{Confident answer?}
    H -->|Yes| I[Display answer with citations]
    H -->|No| J[Request clarification or suggest search terms]
    I --> K[User reviews answer]
    K --> L{Satisfied?}
    L -->|Yes| M[Save to conversation history]
    L -->|No| N[Follow-up question option]
    N --> D
```

#### Edge Cases & Error Handling:

- No relevant documents found - Suggest alternative search terms or document upload
- AI service unavailable - Fallback to traditional search with apology message
- Language mixing (Arabic/English) - Auto-detect and process in both languages
- Very long response - Pagination or summary with "show more" option
- Citation links broken - Graceful handling with document title and metadata

**Notes:** Conversation context is maintained across sessions, allowing users to ask follow-up questions. Mobile users can use voice input with automatic language detection for hands-free operation.

### Physical Document Check-out Process

**User Goal:** Request and check out a physical document for temporary use with proper tracking

**Entry Points:** Document viewer "Request Physical Copy" button, Physical Documents section search, barcode scan result

**Success Criteria:** Physical document is reserved, approval obtained if required, location and pickup instructions provided, tracking record created

#### Flow Diagram
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User finds physical document] --> B[Click "Request Physical Copy"]
    B --> C[Check availability status]
    C --> D{Available?}
    D -->|No| E[Show current holder & due date]
    D -->|Yes| F[Request form with purpose]
    F --> G{Approval required?}
    G -->|No| H[Immediate reservation]

    L --> M[Location map & shelf details]
    M --> N[Physical retrieval by staff/user]
    N --> O[Barcode scan confirmation]
    O --> P[Check-out complete]
```

#### Edge Cases & Error Handling:
- Document already checked out - Show due date and reservation queue option
- User lacks permission for document type - Clear permission requirements message
- Approval timeout - Automatic escalation with notification to requestor
- Physical document not found at location - Report missing item workflow
- Barcode scan failure - Manual entry option with validation
- Overdue previous documents - Block new requests until returns are made

**Notes:** Mobile scanning interface allows field staff to update check-out status in real-time, with offline capability for areas with poor connectivity.
